Can you offer suggestions, design and/or help implement that approach? We\\\'ll provide all the details you require (costs to us, pricing schedules we\\\'ve considered, known target markets, etc.), but we need that extra push from a creative and dedicated soul who believes, as we do, in the power of art and first-person narrative to open hearts and minds to the experience of war and intolerance.

Allow ordinary citizens of the United States the ability to run for public office without spending a fortune on advertising and campaigning or collecting copious signatures. 2. Educate voters about the write-in voting process as a way to feel empowered when the ballot system does not offer an attractive candidate. Write-in and/or independent candidates will break up the duopoly in our congress. 3. Give voters a venue for posting solutions to our nation’s problems. 4. Provide a social networking web for voters to build consensus, thus raising the capacity to effect real change. 5. Encourage voting for those people who heretofore have felt disenfranchised or un-represented by the traditional political system. Here\\\'s our Donate page: http://www.writeindependent.org/donation.php?id=8 but we also write letters to big donors and we\\\'re trying to reach out to grassroots organizations whose lobbying groups are not as well funded as Big Biz, but who still spend a lot each year to block bad legislation (that favors Big Biz) or pass bills that help level the playingfield for small biz.

We specifically will be raising money for our national internship program that trains and prepares college students to enter the social sector. This program is one of our flagship programs and we are growing and need to hire an additional program manager. These fundraisers will help us raise additional awareness and resources for our program. You can learn more at http://sisgigroup.org/preparation/internship-experience/ Here\\\'s some info about our event and why we\\\'re doing it: Happy Hours will take place in a centrally located bar, restaurant or lounge close to public transportation and easy to find. We will invite our locally based volunteers, Board Members, Staff and Partners. All invited guests are asked to bring atleast two other people and we are looking for venues that would be interested in working with us as a fundraiser. This could be in a portion of proceeds from the event or allow a deep discount on drinks or food and we charge for tickets or a cover. We will also have a raffle and other giveaways. We are looking for places that are fun and would be open to supporting this type of small fundraiser. If you know any place that would be great please share! Thanks for your help!' },

One of the ways we raise money is by having supporters start their own fundraising campaigns where they can raise money for an entire well, or even a toilet. The idea is you set a target and raise money towards that goal. What we are looking for is a page that makes people want to get motivated and excited about raising the money to build a well in Africa.Now just to be clear, even though everyone would love the chance to go to Africa and help build the well, this just isn\\\'t practical. First of all the drilling is done by big drilling rigs and they can be dangerous, and secondly if everybody that wanted to help actually traveled to Africa we would be spending all of our time being tour guides and would not have the time to actually help the kids there.That said, you want to help and here is your chance. Can you design a page that would make you want to get involved and help change hundreds of children\\\'s lives? Can you create something that all of your friends would look at and say \\"I want to be involved, I want to help\\"? If you can we would love to see it.We are looking for some great graphics, but if you can combine those graphics with text we are definitely open to the idea.Thanks and looking forward to seeing what you come up with. ' },

     text: 'Increase the Google Grants spend and volume of traffic delivered to a non-profits website. It\\\'s important to point out that all Google Grantees received a $10,000 per month AdWords account allowance, free of change, yet many non-profits struggle to spend it. The primary goals of this challenge is to increase the non-profits spend, ideally the entire $10,000 grant. The secondary goal is to improve the overall efficiency of the account, driving as many conversions as possible. Step 1: Reply to this post to let them know that you\\\'re in! Include a 1-2 sentence introduction and link to your LinkedIn profile or website. If there are multiple volunteers interested in this Challenge, the non-profit will select the 1 expert that they would like to work with. Don\\\'t be offended if you\\\'re not chosen, there are plenty of other great organizations that need your help, please find another Challenge.  We would prefer that you use the message board below for ongoing communication with the non-profit. If both parties would rather exchange e-mail addresses that’s ok too, just make sure to direct them back to Mediacause.org to post future online marketing challenges. Step 2: Work together to set up account access for your e-mail address as well as connect@mediacause.org. If they need assistance, you can share these set up instructions. Step 3: Review conversion tracking set up.  It\\\'s vital that each non-profits is properly tracking conversions in their account. After you learn more about the goals of the account and before you review the account structure, keywords and creatives, make sure that conversion tracking is properly set up and tracking the conversions corresponding with the goals of the campaign. If the non-profit needs to take further action to set up conversion tracking, reply directly to this challenge with instructions. Step 4: Optimize the account to increase delivery, adding new keywords, writing more compelling creative, and removing ads with low CTR.  Working with Google Grantees can be a little tricky, check out this list of tips if this is your first time working with a non-profit in AdWords. Step 5: Reply to the challenge to let the non-profit know that you\\\'re done. Include a summary of the work you performed. You\\\'re DONE!

Here\\\'s the text we need to jazz up: \nSustainable Agriculture Training Center (SATC):  Main Objective \n“Reach and influence the greatest number of farmers, women and youth who promote, develop and advocate Sustainable Agriculture principles and technologies.”\nSATC institutionalizes the capability building efforts of SIBAT in Sustainable Agriculture (SA) for it to provide more sustained and effective technological resources to the growing number of farmers, practitioners and advocates of organic farming.\n \nSATC provides trainings to farmers, community organizations, local government units and non-government organizations and interested individuals on skills and knowledge about SA and appropriate technology.\n \nSATC is housed in Mangarita Organic Farm which demonstrated how SA can sustainably support farming households, here participants learn the skills of how SA technologies are applied.\nMore and more farmers, practitioners and advocates of SA in the different sectors are recognizing SATC as a venue to further their knowledge and skills in SA principles and technologies.\nFor this year, SATC has received numerous requests for trainings and exposure trips to the organic demonstration farm, most of which are farmer’s and women’s organization.  It is very hard for us to turn down some requests as we cannot accommodate all of them with the little funds that we generate from the demo farm.\nTo cater to their needs, SATC needs to further improve the facilities of the demo farm and training center. Now, the training center can accommodate 15 participants in its very simple Nipa House cum training center and requests coming in are for groups of 30 to 50 participants. Training materials (audio-visual and other training modalities) are also limited and needs improvement to cater to the growing number of requests and to better share the principles of SA.

Step 2:  Brainstorm innovative things we can do to host an awesome like drive.  Ideas currently in the queue include speaking to high schools and pushing a like drive amongst that community, and also tying the number of likes to a specific goal.  I.e. 5000 extra likes by the end of the year will provide enough money to build a specific classroom.  (5000 @ $2 per like = $10,000 - cost of building a classroom in Nicaragua) Step 3:  Respond with your ideas, and we can even discuss over skype.\n Thanks so much for your interest in Making Education Possible.\nIf you would like to help our organization in the future, add us to your favorites. attached file:\t' },

We need you to help us out by researching the Twitter Handles of some of the big online influencers in our field.\nSome background info:  Of the approximately 150,000 live births occurring in Los Angeles County each year, over 22,000 women experience clinical perinatal depression. Perinatal or maternal depression encompasses a range of mood disorders that can affect a woman during pregnancy and around the time of birth. Left untreated, maternal depression leads to long-term depression in the mother, a lack of emotional availability for the baby and detrimental outcomes in the development of the fetus, newborn and developing child.  The good news is that perinatal depression is highly treatable and often preventable.  The Los Angeles County Perinatal Mental Health Task Force aims to remove barriers to the prevention, screening and treatment of prenatal and postpartum depression in LA County. \nSome context: The Task Force is quite small and young, but we are growing by leaps and bounds.  We are about to launch a new website, we are in the process of filming a television and radio PSA and we are planning a bunch of activities to take place during May, which has been declared Perinatal Depression Awareness Month throughout the county and the State of California.  We need to build our supporter base so that we can promote our work and these various initiatives to a wider audience. Step 1:  Check out our soon-to-be launched website at http://www.laperinatal.com (although the new URL will be maternalmentalhealthla.org), Facebook page  at http://www.facebook.com/LACountyPerinatalMentalHealth and Twitter page at https://twitter.com/#!/PMHTaskForce to get a good understanding our our organization and cause.  Step 2:  Research and find the big online twitter influencers in our field. wefollow.com and twittorati.com are two great websites for researching.

We want our annual appeal letter to stand out from the rest. Please take a look at our first draft and give us feedback on how we can improve it\nThe Wilmerding YMCA – Strengthening the Communities We Serve.\n \nThroughout our history, the Wilmerding YMCA has been a beacon in this area, serving our communities for more than 100 years. Throughout that time we have worked to address the changing needs and issues facing our residents. Today, the communities we serve are not the same, and neither is the YMCA. \n \n2010 was a year of change for our staff, members, facility, community and our nation. Economic conditions dramatically increased the need for programs and subsidies in our communities. Through collaborations with governments, schools and area service agencies, and especially with support from our donors, we have been able to rise to those challenges. In 2010, the Wilmerding YMCA provided $72, 438.63 in subsidized memberships and programs to more than 8,750 local youth, families and seniors. These subsidies came directly from donations raised in our annual campaigns and donor-designated dollars. \n \nAs we look forward to the coming year, we see the needs of our community constantly changing and growing. Families continue to struggle, children continue to be at risk, seniors continue to need social and physical support, and communities continue to face budget cuts to the services they provide. The Wilmerding YMCA promises to step up to address these needs through new community outreach and programming efforts. Some of our new offerings include special needs day camp and swimming opportunities, collaborating with local schools and parents to provide enrichment programs during at-risk times for youth, expanding senior wellness programs throughout our community, and creating achievement and prevention programs to service at-risk youth as well as mentoring programs for youth in the Braddock area.\n \nThe YMCA is changing lives in our community every day and providing new opportunities to enrich the lives of our children. It is because of the generosity of donors like you that we are able to make positive and significant impacts within our communities. We wanted to let you know that this year we are announcing our new banner program. Any individual, organization or business who contributes a minimum of $1000 to the campaign will have a banner displayed in our facility for the next year in addition to their names on our plaque in the lobby. I hope you will be interested in this additional opportunity to display your commitment to this community. Whether you choose to give a one-time gift, make monthly installments, or a combination of both, please know that what you give will make a difference in the lives of those around you. \n            \nThank you for supporting the Wilmerding YMCA, and helping us to build strong kids, strong families and strong communities.\n \nAnd finally, if you find yourself in the situation where you are in need of assistance, please know that through the generosity of so many, support is available to you as well.\n \n \nSincerely,\n \n \n \n \nD. Scott Heasley\nExecutive Director\n \n]. Here\\\'s some info about us and what we\\\'re doing: THe Wilmerding YMCA has been addressing the needs of the communities we serve since 1896. Each year we provide services to over 10,000 children, adults, families and seniors. We are more than a swim and gym, we are a family of members who have found a place to belong. Many of our family could not belong without the financial support of your neighbors. Please join them in helping those in need.\nThanks!attached file:\t2011 ask Letter.doc' },

Here\\\'s some info about us and the sessions\nThe ‘Animate Learning’ project will develop number skills with parents and children through technology and film. We want  to reach socially excluded Dads to develop skills to support their children’s learning, their own learning and their own future employability. The successful models developed will be compiled in an online guide for others to use to develop their own similar workshops in Year 2.\nWe will work with men from Black, Minority and Ethnic groups, including asylum seekers and recent arrivals in the UK, in a supportive and non-threatening environment. Within the animations they produce they will be able to use their own experiences e.g. counting in their mother tongue. So format needs to be easy for people that don\\\'t read English to understand. Here\\\'s some info about what the poster should look like: Size: To print on A4Font: A simple font to read as some dads may have very basic levels of English. We would like to be able to use a free font as we may want to adapt the posters for different settings. Please no comic sans!Layout: PortraitColour: Full colour but should look good if printed in back and white\nThey should include the following: Graphics: We are interested in comic style superheros, or plasticine influenced characters, similar to wallace and grommit or numbers.

We are setting our collection goals based on the supply lists for students receiving free or reduced lunch.  This large scale effort requires us rethink our marketing plan and create an easily recognizable identity in the community. To do this, we need a logo.\nWe have a general idea of what we want our logo to look like, but need a professional to really make it look awesome! We would like the logo to include: A graphic or picture of kids running with backpacks (see attachment for an idea), the words Ready, Set, School!,  and Hanover County\\\'s School Supply Drive.  Please note: the attachment was taken from the internet. It is not an original photo and can not be used in the logo.\nWe plan to use this logo on flyers and on large vinyl banners that will be displayed on buses that will be parked outside of area businesses over tax-free weekend. In order to make sure the logo isn\\\'t distorted my guess is that the file size for something like that would need to be fairly large. I will leave this determination up to the professionals!\nWe will want to use this logo year after year and so we would like to be able to have space at the bottom to include dates and collection locations if need be. We would like to be able to edit this area ourselves in a simple program like Paint or Word if at all possible.

Then we want you!\nWe are a young adventure travelling social enterprise currently organising a unique rally in South America. The race will take contestants from Peru, through Ecuador, up to Colombia, across Venezuela and into the jungles of Guyana, where the roads seem to simply disappear.\nEach team will be doing some fundraising for charities before setting off and will be stopping in various different community projects and local initiatives along the way that would benefit from your promotions and exposure.\nThe race will then culminate in a party in Georgetown; Guyana where the cars will be donated to people that could benefit their local community with them, such as teachers and doctors.\nWe are looking for a dynamic and creative fundraising marvel that is looking to put their campaigning skills to the test. This will be an ideal opportunity for anybody looking to play a key part in the successful launch of a social enterprise. You will have a huge impact on the company’s performance and we will definitely credit you for it!\nWe are looking for somebody to help us in our fundraising efforts for both the overall rally and our small and cheerful group of intrepid adventurers, who will be the first to undertake this challenging route. We are looking to secure some corporate sponsorship in exchange for exposure in our site and all over our cars. This sponsorship not only will allow us to physically reach the local initiatives and community projects that we want to support, but will also allow us to promote our cause and the great work that our chosen charities are doing.\nSo we could really do with your help in securing the first sponsor. This should allow us to break the Catch 22 of start ups and get the ball rolling towards...other sponsorships!\nSo if the idea of putting your fundraising experience to use in a positive way and having a great impact on others floats your boat, then get in touch at juan@theincarally.com. The rally kicks off in August 2012, so the action will start very soon!attached file:\t' },

In the initial meetings of the steering committee, one major outcome for the SP process was determined: The development of a five-year comprehensive plan with directions and strategies that would be user-friendly and that would hold the organization accountable for results.  The SP process would also be on-going and would include semi-annual reviews of progress on achieving measurable goals.

They can not afford to send their children to the city for their higher education. So they either don’t go to school or drop out school education in the mid. This project will help to increase regularities in school and cut down the number of drop out students.\nPeople’s active participation and keen concerns in this project is another important asset. They are ready to support the project whatever best possible way either by labor donation or by providing local resources. They have already contributed financial and labor donations to build up the school foundations. Now rest of works is underway to completion. Government agencies, people’s representatives and the whole communities are committed for its sustainable development. The project is going to get forty percent of cash donation in total of estimated budget including plenty of other kind donations from the people in local level.

Be sure to check out our website www.crisisservices.org so that you can learn about what we do!  Here\\\'s some info about us and what we\\\'re doing:  We have just begun a full time fund development program and are in the process of sending out our second appeal letter. I\\\'d like a great thank you to send to our donors. Here\\\'s the appeal letter:\nIt seems like we see suicide in the headlines a lot lately.  Too much.\nWhether we’re talking about our teens, our veterans, or our elderly, we watch the suicide rates climb and we sit on the sidelines wondering what can be done.\nMore legislation isn’t going to fix it.  Celebrity attention isn’t going to make it better.  Tributes, while something we are all drawn to, only glamorize it.\nAnd while we may reduce the pressures that seemingly push people to take their lives – these causes will never disappear.  Bullying, war, depression, abuse, loneliness -- are all a part of life whether we like it or not.\nSo what to do?  How can we stop suicide?  How can we tell those that are near and not-so-near that this course of action is exactly the wrong course of action?  How can we spot those who are in trouble\nTo be frank – if you want to stop suicide, get in the game.  \nHow?  Just pay attention.  That simple, but also that difficult.  Our world is noisier today.  Our lives are challenged with more pressures and more distractions than the lives of our parents and grandparents.  But the fact remains that suicide IS preventable.  If we pay attention.\nKnow the signs – a list appears on the back of this letter – and know what to do.  First, listen.  Second, take it seriously.  Third, let them know how much you care and that they are not alone.  And fourth, contact a professional for help.\nCrisis Services is our community’s go-to comprehensive source for crisis counseling solutions.  Our crisis counseling professionals are a phone call away, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Anytime.  When needed, call 834-3131.  We’ll answer. And we’ll help.\nSo how else can you help?  By supporting Crisis Services efforts to be more proactive than reactive.  To take preventative programs deep into the community.  To make suicide prevention a bigger part of our collective consciousness.  Crisis Services has increasingly been called on to take the lead in working with schools, community organizations, churches and others.  Your support – your donation – will help us extend our reach.  Your dollars today will save lives tomorrow.  \nLet’s make this year a year of difference.  Let’s rally our community into understanding that we all matter.  Join us in being a part of the solution.  Get in the game.  Give generously.  Give today.\nOn behalf of the life you will save, thank you!\n Thanks!' },

     text: 'Suicide Prevention and Crisis Service, Inc. began operation in November of 1968 after two years of strategic planning by the Mental Health Association, the Psychological Association of WNY, the Community Welfare Council, and the Erie County Department of Mental Health. It was developed to have broader purposes and concerns in the area of emergency mental health services than currently available by offering a 24/7 response.\r\n\r\nThe service was designed to fill the community’s need for an innovative unit that would explore new methods of treating and assisting people in emotional crisis through a variety of therapeutic services. It was to also provide training and educational programs in crisis intervention and have a comprehensive research component supporting the whole service. Crisis Services exists to fill the same needs today, but has adapted service delivery with respect to social needs and funding.\r\n\r\nCrisis Services of Erie County is the most comprehensive crisis center in upstate New York. Crisis Services fulfills community needs through the following program services:\r\n\r\n    24 Hour Hotline – Crisis Counseling Center\r\n    Emergency Outreach Services\r\n    Trauma Response Services\r\n    The Advocate Program- Rape, Domestic Violence, Family Violence and Elder Abuse\r\n    Outreach to the Homeless\r\n    Community Education and Training\r\n    Police Mental Health Coordination Project\r\n\r\nCrisis Services works to be the best agency to address issues related to emergency mental health by decreasing hospitalizations, suicides, violence, homelessness and other issues that accompany these social ills.\r\n\r\nCrisis Services has more than fulfilled the aspirations and proposals set forth many years ago. It has grown and developed to be an important link in the network of critical services provided by Erie County. Crisis Services is equipped with state-of-the-art fiber optic telecommunication resources and uses an extensive directory of programs to provide information and referral to callers. Crisis Services is certified by the American Association of Suicidology, we are the NYS Deptartment of Health Designated Rape Crisis Center, and the NYS Approved Non-Residential Domestic Violence Service Provider. We are also a United Way Member Agency.\r\n\r\nThe credit for our success goes to our excellent staff and volunteers who work long and difficult hours to provide these services. This comprehensive care is provided by 70 full and part-time staff with the support of 125 professionally trained volunteers. We are fortunate to have people dedicated to this work and who demonstrate commitment to improving the quality of life in Erie County.' },

And, with the pace of technological change these days, tablets are a volunteer\\\'s best friend.   We\\\'ve recently realized that tablets are just the equipment update that our organization needs to super-charge our mission.  \nWe are Discovered Money.  We have a passion for unclaimed property.  Throughout America (and other countries), money is lost and forgotten each and every day.  When people change their address, some of their hard earned funds are at-risk of not making the same move.  This means that utility deposits, payroll checks and other refunds never get cashed by the payee.  By law, those funds are remitted to the county, state or federal government for safekeeping.  The treasurers of these jurisdictions then attempt to locate the rightful owners of the money and return it to them.  Usually, the treasurers do not have the resources to research and communicate with likely candidates.  Therefore, the amount of money held in trust climbs higher and higher.\nWe advocate for the people.  We believe the unclaimed property (cash, stocks and other property) held in state coffers should be returned to the rightful owners swiftly and easily.  Our mission is to educate the general public about the entire unclaimed property process from beginning to end.  Our goals include notifying individuals who did not know they are due these missing funds & assisting them with the sometimes complex claims process.\nOur volunteer work is very data intensive and very visual.  We consistently access gigabytes of data across software and web platforms.  We scour databases for individuals, schools, other non-profits and businesses in an effort to return the money to the rightful owner.  Our volunteers are also very mobile.  We are constantly working away from the office and conducting these searches on the road.  We visit with people in shopping malls, offices, nursing homes and schools.  In order to be effective with our mission, we need wi-fi ready tablet computers so that we can show the public exactly what we found - the unclaimed property records (the proof!)  Our budget does not allow for new tablet purchases at this time.  \nWe\\\'re looking for your creative input!  How can we attract donations of used Android tablets and iPads?  (We would accept any and all models - old and new.)  Or, should we fundraise the dollars to buy new equipment?  We\\\'d love it if you could help us come up with a bunch of new ideas. \nHere\\\'s our webite for more info: Discovered Money is an IRS-approved 501(c)(3) charity.

Step 1: If you\\\'re ready to help this non-profit, please start by replying to this post to let them know that you\\\'re IN! Step 2: Read the client brief in its entirety. Read at least 5 pages of the organization\\\'s website to better understand how they communicate with their users online. Post clarifying questions or request more information if there is anything else you need. Step 3: Download our sample keyword research template. We know there are many ways to do keyword research and many variables worthy of tracking but please follow the template to ensure consistency for our non-profits. Step 4: Develop a comprehensive keyword list and categorize each one into groups of like words or phrases. Step 5: Once you\\\'ve categorized all of the keywords, switch to the second tab of the excel template and create two keyword groups. The first one should include the most relevant and important words to the non-profit; they typically describe the organization and core products/services. If there are similar terms (non-profit vs nonprofit, synonyms, plurals, etc) always select the one with higher monthly volume. These keywords are the immediate targets for the organization, and should be added to existing pages of their website.  In the second group, select the highest volume terms that the non-profit does not have the content to target as long they are still relevant to the organization. While the first group represents immediate target keywords, these are words that the organization would need to build new content around in order to target. Keep this group under 10 keywords. Step 6: Reply to the challenge with the keyword report attached to let the non-profit know that you\\\'re done. You\\\'re DONE!

The deliverable is a report that will be used by other volunteers to complete future challenges that will increase the traffic to our website. As you know, keywords are the foundation to successful SEO. Please lend a hand to help this non-profit get started with SEO! Step 1: If you\\\'re ready to help this non-profit, please start by replying to this post to let them know that you\\\'re IN! Step 2: Read the client brief in its entirety. Read at least 5 pages of the organization\\\'s website to better understand how they communicate with their users online. Post clarifying questions or request more information if there is anything else you need. Step 3: Download our sample keyword research template. We know there are many ways to do keyword research and many variables worthy of tracking but please follow the template to ensure consistency for our non-profits. Step 4: Develop a comprehensive keyword list and categorize each one into groups of like words or phrases. Step 5: Once you\\\'ve categorized all of the keywords, switch to the second tab of the excel template and create two keyword groups. The first one should include the most relevant and important words to the non-profit; they typically describe the organization and core products/services. If there are similar terms (non-profit vs nonprofit, synonyms, plurals, etc) always select the one with higher monthly volume. These keywords are the immediate targets for the organization, and should be added to existing pages of their website.  In the second group, select the highest volume terms that the non-profit does not have the content to target as long they are still relevant to the organization. While the first group represents immediate target keywords, these are words that the organization would need to build new content around in order to target. Keep this group under 10 keywords. Step 6: Reply to the challenge with the keyword report attached to let the non-profit know that you\\\'re done. You\\\'re DONE! If you would like to help this non-profit with future SEO challenges make sure to add them as a favorite.' },

The speaking authors get 10-15 minutes to share information about their book and themselves to the audience, and our guest authors get 1 minute each to introduce themselves and their book(s) while the guests are enjoying a sit down dinner.  We also give out a student scholarship at this event.\nWine & Music is our gala event where we have a live and silent auction, food vendors, wine vendors and live music.  It is our biggest event!\nHowever, we are ready to switch things up!!  We want to combine the literacy part of Book & Author with the fun, party aspect of Wine & Music.  So, we are starting an event called, \\"Reading Between the Wines.\\"  Guests will first enjoy wine while hearing from a major author, a few guest authors and the scholarship winner.  Then, they can either visit our guest authors, mingle with them and have their books signeed and/or move into the party room with food and more wine and the silent and live auction.  It will be a fun event that is unlike a regular gala (which our area has too many of).\nInstructions for the challenge:\nWe need a logo that will be the event logo for this year, and every year that we do this event.  So, we need something generic that we can use on all of our correspondence, but something that is unique.  Please play off of the title, \\"Reading Between the Wines.\\"  I will need the logo in a jpeg format that will print clearly on everything (high resolution).  I am not picky with colors, in fact, I would like it to have a color scheme, but it needs to be able to be printed in black and white as well.\nHere\\\'s some info about us and what we\\\'re doing: Our mission at the Literacy Council is to end inter-generational cycles of illiteracy in Fort Bend County by improving adult literacy skills and generating community-wide literacy awareness.  We offer Basic Literacy classes, GED classes, English as a Second Language classes, Computer classes, Citizenship classes and more.  Visit our website for additional information:  www.ftbendliteracy.org.Here\\\'s some info about what the logo should look like: Size: Ne restrictions, it just has to be \\"sharp\\" when placed on different correspondence in different sizes. Font: No restrictions.  If you use an unique font, please send it to me to load on the computer.Due Date:  April 18, 2012 Here are some other ideas to get you started: Wine & Music generic logo (Trans Logo in Black.png)\nWine & Music logo for this year (WineLabel copy 3.jpg)\nBook & Author logo for this year (Logo with trans bkgnd.png)\nThanks so much!attached files:\t\t\t' },

We assist anyone struggling with poverty, unemployment, underemployment and food insufficiency. For more than 40 years, we have been transforming the lives of the resource poor residents of Fremont, Newark and Union City through programs and services which build hope, skills and self-esteem, when those dispositions are at their lowest.\nOver the past two very tough years, Tri-City Volunteers food bank has risen to the challenge of providing some 3.6 million pounds of nutritious food per year to the 6,000 local families gripped by economic hardship. Prior to 2010, our food distribution was a meager 1.2 million pounds.\n\n\n\n\nThanks!' },

Basically, you\\\'ll just need a username and a simple password. \nOnce you are logged in, you can begin entering trail information. Although any information you add is helpful, the more information you can add, the better. Of course the trail name, location and length are the most important bits of information, it is best if you can also add trail type, trail uses, a description, trail surface, photos and a link (URL) to another website with helpful information about the trail.\nWhere do you find information about the trail? That\\\'s the simple part. First, we recommend that you focus on a particular geographic region such as your town, county, or state. (Currently trailsnet is just set up for trails in the United States, but that will change over time.) Next, you choose a specific trail entity such as national park trails, Forest Service trails, rail trails, urban trails, etc. Then search the internet for a list of trails that meet your criteria. For example, if you decide on trails in a certain town, you would find that park\\\'s official website and locate their trails web page. Then click on the links to each trail and transfer the information to trailsnet.net. It is easiest to do this if you have two browser windows open at a time or two tabs in the same browser window so you can click back and forth between the two quite easily. For trail descriptions, please put as much of that into your own words. The photos is the really fun part. You should not use photos from another website without the owners permission, so that means you\\\'ll have to go out and take your own photos. Although photos aren\\\'t required, it\\\'s a lot of fun to explore the trails and take pictures. By the way, if you have your own trails website, you can use your photos with attribution to your website. You can also provide a link to your own trail website.\nCurrently, it\\\'s a bit difficult to add trail maps to trailsnet.net. That\\\'s another area where we could use a techie volunteer. Although it is possible to add a map, you must have the google map code available. If you have that, great!! Please add that code in the \\"add map code\\" section of the \\"Add a Trail\\" section of trailsnet.net. You can also send a KML, KMZ or GPX file/code via email when you send your trail information and a trailsnet guru can add that information manually. If you have experience with WordPress mapping plugins, trailsnet would appreciate your help setting up that feature on our site. In the meantime...\nOur first goal is quite attainable and we hope you will help us reach it. We\\\'d like at least 20 trails added to trailsnet.net in the next 20 days. That could be 20 people adding one trail each, 10 people each adding two trails, one person... well you get the picture. Thanks for helping trailsnet build a network of trails on the network. We\\\'re making it easy for people to find their next favorite trail.attached file:\t' },

.. बोलू. एक आहे प्रसाद चिक्षे यांचा ब्लॉग. मराठीत, आणि किमान गुगल-क्रोमवर उघडणे कठीण. शिवाय एका वेळी एकच नोंद येताना फार वेळ खाणारा हा ब्लॉग, असा विविध सिस्टीम्सवरचा अनुभव आहे. ही तांत्रिक अडथळय़ांची शर्यत जिंकलात, तर जणू बक्षीस म्हणून ग्रामीण महाराष्ट्राबद्दल आणि तिथल्या साध्याच व्यक्तींच्या प्रवृत्तींबद्दल होत असलेले वेगळे लिखाण वाचायला मिळेल. प्रामुख्याने आत्मनिवेदन, अगदी आत्मचरित्रात्मक तपशील, हेच या ब्लॉगमधील नोंदींचे बाह्यरूप दिसते. नोंदींची भाषा बाळबोध म्हणावी, अशी आहे. ब्लॉगलेखक प्रसाद चिक्षे यांना भाजपसारख्या पक्षाच्या प्रसिद्धीविषयक कामासाठी बोलावणे आले होते असा निष्कर्ष ब्लॉगवरील कुठल्या तरी एका सूचक उल्लेखाचा जरा विचार केल्यावर काढता येत असला, तरी त्यावर विश्वास बसणे कठीण व्हावे, अशी भाषेची रीती! आशयातून जे तत्त्वाग्रह पुढे येतात, ते मूलत: ज्ञानप्रबोधिनी आणि विवेकानंद केंद्र यांच्या विचारधारांतले आहेत. हे तत्त्वाग्रह आणि ग्रामीण महाराष्ट्रातील सद्यस्थिती यांचा संघर्ष लेखकाच्या मनात सुरू असल्याचे काही नोंदी सांगतात, तेव्हा वाचकही जणू त्या संघर्षांत ओढला जातो. ‘तात्यांनी अंबाजोगाईत ‘प्रगती कोचिंग क्लासेस’ या नावाने शिकवणी वर्ग सुरू केले. ’ हा एक  २७ फेब्रुवारीच्या नोंदीतील परिच्छेद असा संघर्ष खूपच संयमाने मांडणारा आहे. त्यात म्हटलं आहे -‘शिक्षकाला पैसे देऊन विद्या विकत घेता येते हे बाळकडू गावातील कर्त्यां लोकांच्या मुलांना एकदा समजलं की मग ते गावासाठी काय करणार? त्यात पैसा न घेता, परीक्षेच्या एक-दोन दिवस आधी गुरुजींनी दिलेला ‘गेस पेपर’ परीक्षेत जशाचा तसा आला की मुले खूश, शिक्षक ‘पॉप्युलर’ व पालक मुलांचे मार्क पाहून आपण किती चांगल्या प्रकारे कर्तव्य पार पाडत आहोत हे समाजात मिरवायला मोकळे. अशा या शैक्षणिक माहोलमध्ये इंग्रजीसारख्या विषयाचे शिकवणी वर्ग, त्यातल्या त्यात ग्रामीण भागातील व बहुजन समाजातील एखादा तरुण ज्यावेळी यात उतरतो त्यावेळी त्याला थोडं अवघड जातं. निसर्गाच्या सहवासात राबलेल्यांना रासायनिक खतांनी समृद्ध झालेल्या हायब्रीडच्या दुनियेशी जुळवून घेणं फारसं अवघड जात नसतं, कारण त्याच्या रोमारोमांत लढाऊपण मुरलेलं असतं. बाजारू समाजव्यवस्थेची, (अशा व्यवस्थेतील-) प्रचार व आचार पद्धतींची आता तात्याला चांगली ओळख झाली होती. थोडय़ा महिन्यात तात्याच्या क्लासेसला बऱ्यापैकी मुलं यायला लागली.’नोंद लांबीला मोठी आहे, पण तिचा हा भाग वाचल्यावर लेखक तात्यावर न चि���ता समाजावर चिडला आहे, हे लक्षात यावं! तात्यांनी कोणते कष्ट लहानपणीच घेतले होते, याचा उल्लेख या नोंदीच्या अगदी सुरुवातीलाच आहे. या प्रकारचे संघर्ष, या प्रकारचे अनुभव मांडणारे मराठी ब्लॉगर सध्या कमी आहेत. विशिष्ट आर्थिक/ सामाजिक वर्गाचा विरंगुळा म्हणून जे मराठी ब्लॉगिंग सुरू आहे, त्याला छेद देणाऱ्या अशा आणखीही काही नोंदी सापडतात.या दोन ब्लॉगचीच चर्चा इथं करण्याचं कारण असं की, ‘वाचावे नेटके’च्या ईमेल पत्त्यावर ‘यांच्याबद्दलचं मतप्रदर्शन आवश्यक आहे’ अशा स्वरूपाचे ईमेल आले होते. ‘समीक्षा’, ‘अभिप्राय’ हे शब्द वापरून - म्हणजे ब्लॉगबद्दल अशा स्वरूपाची मतप्रदर्शने वैध असतात, हे मान्य करून मगच आणि ‘हा माझा ब्लॉग आहे’ असेही स्वच्छ लिहून घानाच्या ब्लॉगबद्दल दोन महिन्यांपूर्वी कळवले होते. प्रसाद चिक्षे यांच्या ब्लॉगबद्दल ‘प्रसाद एस. जोशी’ यांनी कळवले, त्याबद्दल त्यांचे आभार. मराठी ब्लॉगिंग ‘साडेतीन टक्क्यां’च्या समाजात अडकलेले नाही, त्यापलीकडे जाऊन काही तरुण ‘उपेक्षितांचे अंतरंग’ शोधू पाहात आहेत, ही जाणीव सुखद आहे! उल्लेख झालेल्या ब्लॉगांचे पत्ते : http://ghanaxp.blogspot.in/http://prasadchikshe.blogspot.inनेट-वाचन/ अभिप्राय/ समीक्षेच्या उपक्रमात सहभागासाठी ईमेल : wachawe.netake@expressindia.com mailto: wachawe.netake@expressindia.com   \n\n\n\n\nHIGHLY obliged and will really apppreciate the gesture.\n \nSamta Arora\niVolunteer Overseas' },

This school had no library books or media resources for student use, and significantly, the school was also failing to meet national testing standards as established by the No Child Left Behind Act. The majority of its students were similarly not meeting state grade level standards in reading and writing and the school was ranked near the bottom of all elementary schools in the state of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nLibrary Build is an innovative and unique organization that seeks to provide public school students with fully functional, complete libraries, and access to dedicated librarians. While literacy and educational equality have long been the focus of nonprofits and programs, none have focused on library creation, maintenance, and sustainability. In short, there is no comprehensive organization, or grant program, in the United States that provides America’s chronically underfunded schools with functional libraries, resources they need, and with dedicated librarians.\r\n\r\nLibrary Build is committed to creating sustainable working libraries for use in America’s chronically underfunded schools, with the goal of helping all children to be able to read and write and thus be successful as they progress in their education.' },

Can you give us a hand?\nWe need this done by Wednesday, April 4th.\nHere\\\'s some info about us and the event:\nVolunteers of America offers many programs in Colorado, including the RSVP program.  RSVP is a nation-wide program whose purpose is to connect volunteers age 55 and better with meaningful volunteer opportunitites that meet critical community needs.  The RSVP program is one aspect of the national Senor Corps. RSVP programs are sponsored locally by community nonprofits.   Volunteers of America is the local sponsor of this program in Larimer County, CO.  Our 800+ RSVP Volunteers (ages 55 to 93!) serve at over 60 local organizations where they mentor kids, serve the hungry, help restore natural areas, provide transportation to people with disabilities, and more. Last year, these volunteers served over 103,000 hours collectively. \nThe Title of our Art Show is taken from the following quote from Dom Helder Camara: When we are dreaming alone, it is only a dream.  When we are dreaming with others, it is the beginning of reality.\nAll works in the show were created by Larimer RSVP volunteers, and each piece is a reflection of the volunteer\\\'s dreams for the community.  The show illustrates how older adult volunteers are working to make these dreams a reality through service.  The show is offered in celebration of national Senior Corps week, as well as Older Americans Month (which is the month of May).\nOpening reception will be held during the \\"First Friday Art Walk\\" on May 4th, 6-9pm in the YES! Gallery of the Poudre River Arts Center located at 406 N. College in Fort Collins.  The show runs through Saturday, May 26th.\nHere\\\'s some info about what the poster should look like:\nSize: 8.5 x 11 OR 8.5 x 14\nFont: NO RESTRICTIONS \nPORTRAIT orientation\nCOLOR\nGRAPHICS: use the attached graphic of older and younger hands. You may include other graphics as well!\nLOGOS: use the attached combined VOA/RSVP Logo (you may alter size).  Senior Corps Week logo optional (see below)\nTEXT: \nInclude the quote from Dom Helder Camara (above) \ninclude show title, place, dates, etc.  \nInclude the following description (doesn\\\'t have to be a single block of text):  Dreaming with Others illustrates what RSVP volunteers in Larimer County are doing to make their dreams for the community a reality. All works in the show were created by Larimer RSVP volunteers, who are individuals age 55 and better working to meet critical local needs through volunteer service. Last year, over 850 RSVP Volunteers served over 103,000 hours at 60 local organizations.\nInclude mention of National Senior Corps week (May 7-11) (if possible).

Each show is broadcast on our local public radio station, KHSU, and is available for download from the KHSU website and on the NEC website. We are interested in expanding our coverage of the EcoNews Report on our website by including transcripts of the show, and are in need of volunteers to listen to the shows and type up the transcripts.\nIf YOU have time to transcribe a few shows, or on a regular basis, please contact us! We would greatly appreciate your help!\nEach half hour show takes approximately 3.5-5 hours to transcribe with 7-12 pages of text as output.\nWe\\\'re looking for a format similar to that used by Democracy Now. Click here for an example: http://www.democracynow.org/2012/2/9/coup_in_maldives_adviser_to_oustedNAME: question.2ND NAME: response.\nPlease capitalize and bold speakers\\\' names. Single space between paragraphs and speakers.\nWord .doc file preferred.\nTips:-While accuracy is very important, it is not necessary to include every \\"umm\\" \\"uh\\" etc. unless it would alter the flow of the conversation to omit them. Use your best judgement.-If you have an audio player with a \\"slow playback speed\\" option (I\\\'m told Windows Media Player does), that might help. Go through at slow speed, then again at regular speed to go over what you have. -If there are unfamilar words or phrases you can\\\'t understand, highlight the text in your transcription for our staff to review. Please visit our archive.org library for our recent shows: http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=northcoast%20environmental%20center\n(If the link doesn\\\'t work, just type \\"northcoast environmental center\\" into the search bar.)\nShows can be downloaded, if you prefer to work offline, by right clicking on the VBR MP3 file.\n**Please include the date of the show and your full name at the top of the file (so we can give you transcription credit) and email completed transcripts to editor@yournec.org.\nThe following shows have already been transcribed:2/16/121/26/1211/3/1110/13/119/22/119/8/119/1/117/28/117/21/116/23/114/28/114/7/113/24/111/19/11' },
